"""Brings the database up to date on every start, so updating the app is
just pulling the new version and starting it.

What it does, in order:
1. Waits for the database to accept connections (and gives up with a clear
   message after a minute, instead of retrying a real error 30 times).
2. Takes a lock so two starting containers never migrate at once.
3. Looks at what the database says its version is:
   - empty database: builds everything from the migrations
   - a version this code has never heard of (the migration history was
     rewritten or squashed since this database was created), or tables
     with no version at all: it is attached to the starting migration and
     brought up to date, keeping all data. Afterwards it is checked against
     the models, and if something the code needs is STILL missing (nothing
     in the history creates it) it stops and says exactly what, instead of
     guessing, and forgets the attachment so the next start checks again.
   - a version that is in the history: nothing special
4. Runs every migration newer than the database.

Rewriting the migration history is therefore safe for existing installs:
any database from the old history is adopted automatically on its next
start. New migrations should still be written to be safe to run twice
(create-if-missing), see docs/migrations.md."""
