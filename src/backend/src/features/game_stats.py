"""Game statistics that need more than a count: playtime spread, the unplayed
pile, cost per hour, backlog hours, achievement completion.

Everything is exact or reported as missing. "No playtime recorded" means the
platform reported none (it is not a claim the game was never played), the
backlog hours only sum games that have a time-to-beat and say how many do
not, and cost per hour only uses games that have both a price and playtime."""
