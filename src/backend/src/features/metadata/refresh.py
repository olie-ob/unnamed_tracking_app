"""Daily background refresh of episode data for shows/anime that already
have episodes synced — catches newly aired episodes for shows still
airing. Same in-process asyncio loop pattern as the trash sweep
(features/trash/sweep.py) and automatic backups
(features/backup/scheduler.py): no new worker container, no new
dependency. Mostly appends episode numbers that aren't already stored
and enriches blank placeholders — a watched or rated episode is never
touched. The one exception: a still-blank placeholder beyond what the
source provider now says has actually aired gets pruned (see
_prune_unaired_episodes), since that only happens from a prior
miscalculation, never from a real episode disappearing."""
