"""The media refresh as a job with progress.

It used to be one request that walked every show and season one at a time,
asking up to four providers each, so a big library took a very long time and
the button showed nothing until the end. Now:

- it only touches what needs it (`mode="needed"`): a show still airing, one
  with no episodes or with untitled ones, or one whose stored total disagrees
  with what AniList says it has. `mode="all"` checks everything;
- AniList is asked once per 50 shows for each one's status and final total,
  and that total is what repairs a season a wrong provider match had inflated;
- several shows are worked on at once (each provider is still paced by the
  shared throttle, so this only overlaps the waiting);
- progress is kept while it runs, so the screen can show it.

A run is started by someone asking for it (the Settings button) or by the
existing daily loop. Only one runs at a time."""
