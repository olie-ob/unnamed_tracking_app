"""Builds notifications from real, exact data. Nothing here estimates: an
episode notification exists only because a provider gave that episode an
air time (or the show's confirmed next-episode time) that has now passed,
and its `event_at` is that exact time.

There is no scheduler: generation runs when the app asks for
notifications (the bell polls), so it costs nothing while nobody is
looking and needs no new background job. Deduplication by `dedupe_key`
makes running it any number of times safe."""
