"""Cleanup jobs: recurring work an administrator can switch on, schedule and
run by hand.

Each job is described once in JOBS. Its schedule is stored in `job_settings`;
a job starts on or off as its spec says (the airing check is on because new
episodes should appear without anyone asking, the full refresh is off because
it is heavy). One loop (started in main.py) wakes every minute, and runs any
enabled job that is due. Running a job by hand, from a screen or from
the loop, goes through the same code and records the same last-run details.

Adding a job is one entry here plus whatever it does; the Tasks screen lists
whatever is registered."""
