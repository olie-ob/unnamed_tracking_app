"""Notices when a TV show you follow gets a new season.

TVmaze lists a show's seasons, announced ones included. When it lists a
season number higher than any we have, that season is added to the show
(so it appears on the title page and the library moves onto it) and, for a
show you are watching or have finished, a "new season listed" notification
is created with the season's premiere date when TVmaze has one.

There is no scheduler: opening a show's page asks for a check when the
last one is more than 3 days old, in the background, so a new season shows
up the next time you look. The very first check of a show adds seasons
silently, so a show added long ago does not produce a burst of old news."""
